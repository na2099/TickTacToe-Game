The game opens in a GUI (Graphical User Interface). It begins by asking the users to enter names for the Player controlling the "X" and the Player controlling the "O". After entering the names, each player would have a chance to select a tile to place their "X" or "O". After one round of the game is over, the name of the winner of that game will be displayed. If the game ends in a tie, "Game over tie" would be displayed. Count of the number of rounds won by each player and the number of ties occured are also displayed.
